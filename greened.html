                    Being greened is a situation that happens to many adults. Over 80% of adults report being greened at some point in their lives. <br />
                    If you find yourself greened, it might be embarrassing, but you are not alone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps you have been greened at the workplace, or in the comfort of your own home. These situations are most common, but people can find
                    themselves greened in a variety of circumstances, and often it is hard to know what to do next.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Regardless of circumstance, you have options and rights as a greened individual.
